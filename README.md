# Aliexpress-Web-Scrapper
Written using Node.js ( Modules include puppeteer, cheerio and aliexpress-product-scraper)

AliExpress web scraper is a software tool that is designed to extract data from AliExpress.com, a popular online marketplace for buying and selling products. 
The tool uses web scraping techniques to automatically crawl and scrape data from the website, such as product descriptions, prices, images, reviews, and more.

This tool works by using automated scripts that crawl through the website's pages and extract the desired information. 
The data can then be saved in a structured format, such as CSV, Excel, or JSON, and analyzed using data analysis tools or imported into other applications.

Installation:
Simply install the dependancies found in package.json

NB: Selenium is one of the modules installed but has not been used in this project. However, its a great alternative to consider.
